This learning project is a demonstration of my understanding of and ability to construct machine learning algorithms from scratch. 

I implemented the following models:
- Classification:
    - KNN
    - Desicion tree
    - Random forest
    - Support vector machine
    - Boosting machines:
        - Adaptive boosting
        - Gradient boosting
- Clusterization:
    - K-means

Each model is tested against its corresponding counterpart from the scikit-learn module with graphical demonstration of the decision rule of each model.
